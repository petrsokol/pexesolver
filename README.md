# PEXESOLVER

This program lets you find an arrangement of user-defined black and white tiles, such that every shared edge matches color. (*show with pictures*)

You can also define the desired superstructure - for the example of 24 different tiles, you can specify whether the resulting arrangement be a 4x6, 3x8 or 2x18. (*show with pictures*)

For a set of tiles where this solution does not exist, you can also toggle an option to show partial solutions (with only one or two tiles missing)
